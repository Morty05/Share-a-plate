# Share-a-plate

Our website connects NGOs and restaurants to facilitate the donation of leftover food to those in need. "Share-a-plate" is an innovative platform designed to bridge the gap between surplus food providers, such as restaurants, and charitable organizations working towards addressing food insecurity. Through this website, restaurants can create accounts and list the surplus food they have available for donation. They can provide details about the type and quantity of food, along with any specifications. NGOs, on the other hand, can browse through the listings, identify suitable donations, and express their interest in picking up the food. 

The platform ensures a streamlined process by facilitating communication between the restaurants and NGOs. Once an NGO expresses interest in a specific food donation, they can coordinate with the restaurant to schedule a pickup or delivery.
